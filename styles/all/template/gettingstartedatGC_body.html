Dear New Player,<br/>
<br/>
     We would like to take this chance to welcome you to Global-Conflict.org aka Global Conflict aka GC.  You have just joined one of the best communities on the net for organized gameplay. At Global Conflict we believe that we are all here for a mature & most important, fun game of BF, and we have made that the basis of our community.  
<br/>
<br/>
     To participate in every battle in the campaigns you will need to download TS (Teamspeak) - we will be getting to that shortly. We guarantee that once you have this done and join us on our servers for the very first time you are going to love what we have created here at Global Conflict.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<font size = 2><b>Eight Simple Steps to Starting at Global-Conflict</b></font>
<br/>
<br/>
     <ol>
         <li>Click <u><a href="http://global-conflict.org/ucp.php?mode=register" target="_blank">here</a></u> to register an account on our site.</li>

<br/>    <li>We use <u><a href="http://www.teamspeak.com/?page=downloads" target="_blank">Teamspeak 3</a></u> to talk to each other. Having a microphone is not mandatory, but you do need TS3 to listen! Go <u><a href="http://global-conflict.org/HowtosetupGCTS3.php" target"_blank">here</a></u> for detailed instructions on how to configure TS3 for our tournament.</li>

<br/>    <li>Our main battles are always on Saturday and last from 19:00 CET (1pm Eastern, Noon Central, 10am Pacific), until 01:00 CET (7pm Eastern, 6pm Central 4pm Pacific). During certain Campaigns we may add Tuesday battles  - watch the forums for information. For more timezones click <u><a href="http://global-conflict.org/whatisSBT_&_worldclock.php" target"_blank">World Clock</a></u>.</li>

<br/>    <li>Sign up to an army using the instructions below.</li>

<br/>    <li>Make sure you sign up on the battle roster in your army barracks for the times you will be able to participate. Make sure you check out the battle strategies for every fight in your army barracks or strategy forum.</li>

<br/>    <li>Try to show up on Teamspeak 30 minutes before the match starts. If you can't join at the start of the fight, make sure you check in on TS before joining the game server. Either way, one of the commanders will assign you to a squad and your squad leader will tell you your assignment within the squad.</li>

<br/>    <li>When in doubt, don't be afraid to ask anyone you see for help (although you should ensure they are GC members).</li>

<br/>    <li>Good luck and have fun!</li>
     </ol>

     Now, this is where your journey really begins, first, you'll want to click this link that will take you to the current active campaign sign-up:

<br/>
<br/>
     Once you've been added to an army, a new forum will open for you that contains Army barracks, Strategy room and Tavern where you hang out.
<br/>
     In the barracks you will see the many squads you can join, simply click on them for further information, some will be air force or spec-ops squad, which may require you to be invited or to try out, some will be basic infantry squads that anyone can join, the choice is up to you, simply read the first post in the squads thread for any info you are required to give, and any info you might require for battles. You will soon be added to that squads roster, assigned a rank, and will be ready to hit the field.
